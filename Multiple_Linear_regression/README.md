# 📊 Multiple Linear Regression on Economic Index Data

## 📝 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using Python. It leverages a dataset (`economic_index.csv`) to explore how different economic indicators influence a target variable, aiming to build a predictive model with explanatory power.

## 📁 Files

- `Multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that includes:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Correlation matrix
  - Model building and evaluation
  - Results visualization
- `economic_index.csv`: The dataset containing economic indicators used for regression analysis.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `Multiple_linear_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run all cells sequentially.

## 📈 Results

The notebook performs:
- A statistical analysis of the features
- Visualization of relationships between features
- Multiple linear regression to predict the target variable
- Model evaluation using metrics such as R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

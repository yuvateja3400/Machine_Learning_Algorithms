# 📊 Simple Linear Regression: Predicting Weight from Height

This project demonstrates the application of **Simple Linear Regression** using Python to predict a person's weight based on their height. The implementation is showcased in a clean and interactive Jupyter Notebook using the `height-weight.csv` dataset.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Build a simple machine learning model that learns the relationship between height and weight and predicts weight for a given height value.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **File**: `height-weight.csv`
- **Features**:
  - `Height` (in inches)
  - `Weight` (in pounds)

This is a classic regression dataset often used for basic ML and statistics demonstrations.

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load and Explore Dataset**
3. **Visualize Data**
4. **Data Preprocessing**
5. **Model Building (Linear Regression)**
6. **Model Evaluation**
7. **Prediction & Visualization**

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes scatter plots, regression line plots, and residual analysis to visually understand the model performance and data distribution.

---

## 🧮 Model Summary

- Model: `LinearRegression()`
- Evaluation Metric: `R² Score`, `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`
- Results:
  - A reasonably strong linear correlation between height and weight
  - Low residual errors

---

## 🔍 Sample Output

```python
Predicted weight for 70 inches: 159.7 lbs
R² Score: 0.93
